    <h1>Client Communication</h1>
    <p><b>Note: Client communication is an entirely different process for group chats, so they are split up into two parts.</b></p>
    <h3>One-on-One Client Communication</h2>
    <p>Client communication begins when one user (let's say John) requests to connect to a different user (let's say Sara).<br>
    If Sara accepts John's request, then her ConnectionManager will create a new Client instance.<br>
    The first thing that will happen now that the two Clients have been created is that Sara will handshake with John.<br>
    The handshake process goes like this,
    <ul>
        <li>first Sara will send the <i>REDY</i> command to John, indicating that the connection to each other is done.</li>
        <li>Sara will then get John's public key, then give her public key to John.</li>
        <li>Sara will then ensure that the rest of the connection is encrypted using AES.</li>
    </ul>
    While this is all happening, John will be initiating the handshake and sending the <i>HELO</i> command to Sara, indicating John would like to start the handshake.<br>
    John will then receive the REDY command from Sara and send his public key, receive her public key, then ensure the rest of the connection is encrypted using AES.<br><br>
    Finally, the handshake is then complete, allowing the client connection to continue.<br> The client communication system after handshake is basically just a loop
    to check if the other client is sending any commands, handle the commands, then decrypt them.<br>
    For example, if John wants to tell Sara that he'll be at work by 3, he'll send a <i>COMMAND_MSG</i> to her.<br> But before he's able to do that,
    first he must encrypt the data (or the payload) then send it as a Message securely.<br>
    Sara will be able to decrypt this data and read the raw text message.<br>
    If John is paranoid that his connection is insecure due to a <i>Man in the Middle (MITM) attack</i> he is able to authenticate the connection.<br>
    He can set a question that only Sara will know the answer to and Sara will have to answer the question properly to authenticate the conversation.<br>
    Hinge uses the <i>Socialist Millionaire Protocol (SMP)</i> in order to authenticate conversations and prevent MITM attacks.<br><br>
    There is also an hmac in order to authenticate data sent between clients. If Sara somehow gets hacked during her conversation and the hacker tries to snoop on the conversation but fails to authenticate, John would be alerted.
    <h3>Group Client Communication</h2>
    Coming soon!
