    <h1>Building</h1>

    <p>To build the Hinge API, first you must install the dependency PyCrypto. PyCrypto is vital for security as it's the crypto library we use, which is the main focus for Hinge.<br>
    Depending on how you install PyCrypto, it might not come with the library it uses, which is `winrandom`. If you are asked to install this, then you will have to install it.<br>
    Then you can clone Hinge and start working.Hinge is an API, so you cannot 'run' Hinge. You can either contribute to the progress of Hinge,<br>
    or help HingeChat (the official chat that uses the Hinge API). Alternatively, you can make your own chat using the Hinge API.</p>
