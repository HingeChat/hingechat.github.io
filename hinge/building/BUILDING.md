Building
========

To build the Hinge API, first you must install the dependency M2Crypto. M2Crypto is vital for security, which is the main focus for Hinge. Then you can clone Hinge and start working.

Hinge is an API, so you cannot 'run' Hinge. You can either contribute to the progress of Hinge, or help HingeChat (the official chat that uses the Hinge API). Alternatively, you can make your own chat using the Hinge API.
